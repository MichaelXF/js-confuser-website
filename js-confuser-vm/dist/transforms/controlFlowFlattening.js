/**
 * Breaks functions into DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)
 *
 * - 1. Break bytecode into chunks
 * - 2. Shuffle chunks but remember their original position
 * - 3. Create an effectively Switch statement inside a While loop, each case is a chunk, and the while loops exits on the last transition.
 *
 * The Switch statement:
 *
 * - 1. The state variable controls which case will run next
 * - 2. At the end of each case, the state variable is updated to the next block of code.
 * - 3. The while loop continues until the the state variable is the end state.

  // create a bare CFF implementation of a simple switch dispatch loop effectively
  // This CFF implementation should only apply to "easy jumps" such as conditional jump (if-statement)
  // the complex and specific jumps for for..in shouldn't get flattened
