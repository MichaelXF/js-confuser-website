Frequently Asked Questions

###### What is JS-Confuser and how does it work?

JS-Confuser is a JavaScript obfuscation tool designed to make your code harder to understand and reverse-engineer. It works by transforming the structure and logic of your code into a less readable form while preserving its original functionality.

###### Should I obfuscate my own code?

Obfuscation helps protect your intellectual property by making it more difficult for unauthorized users to understand, modify, or steal your code. It can deter casual reverse engineers, protect sensitive data like API keys, and harden client-side license checks.

###### Are there any drawbacks?

Obfuscation will likely introduce performance overhead, increase file size, and, in some cases, break your program. These things should be considered when configuring the obfuscation settings.

###### Is obfuscation foolproof?

No, obfuscation is not a perfect solution. A skilled and determined reverse engineer can eventually deobfuscate your code, analyze it for flaws, and potentially extract sensitive information like API tokens or bypass client-side license checks. Obfuscation is a deterrent, not an impenetrable barrier.

###### What are the risks if someone deobfuscates my code?

If someone successfully deobfuscates your code, they can understand its logic, extract sensitive data, find security flaws, and potentially misuse your intellectual property. This could include removing licensing checks or using your proprietary code without authorization.

###### Can obfuscation prevent all forms of code theft?

Obfuscation is a powerful deterrent, but it cannot completely prevent code theft. It raises the bar significantly, making it more challenging and time-consuming for attackers to steal your code. However, no method is completely foolproof, and determined attackers may still find ways to bypass obfuscation.
